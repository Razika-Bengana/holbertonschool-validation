## Description

Empathy as Code: Inline Help, Comment and Documentation

By going to the following website:

    [gohugo.io](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

You'll only need to follow the steps and have a basic knowledge of your command line.

---

## Prerequisites

    - Linux Fundamentals
    - Git for the distributed version control system
    - GitHub to deploy source code
    - Go-Hugo to build the website
    - theme ananke for the website
    - a Makefile present
    - no Git submodules

---

## LifeCycle

    - First you `build`
    - Then you `clean`
    - You may also `post`
    - And if you need, some `help`

---

## Workflow

You are expected to create a new workflow named `module3_task0` with only the following steps:

- Clone the repository
- Position yourself in the correct directory and execute the command `make help` to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help target.

This workflow must be triggered:

- Each time there is new code pushed on your repository
- And once per day (whatever time you want).
